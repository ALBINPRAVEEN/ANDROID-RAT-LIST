# Remote Access Tool Trojan List - Android

This repo contents all RAT trojan android (and [Dataset](https://github.com/wishihab/Android-RAT-Dataset/)) as I know so far (free or paid app) with permission and feature used list for my documentation.

Looking for free port forwarding without buy VPN or Router setting?? Use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)


# Note
Please don't download the project if you won't infected by Trojan and make sure recheck before download or install from unknown source (Trojan in a Trojan??).
